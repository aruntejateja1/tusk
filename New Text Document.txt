Cognizant Learn- Started the ADTEA1 assessment at August 22, 2021 5:37:46 PM IST as part of RDP but the assessment doesn't opened and throws a technical error.  I tried to relaunch the assessment but throws the same technical error. Event though I didn't attempt the assessment, out of 3 attempts I have, one attempt is removed. Could you please consider this issue and add that attempt to make my total attempts to 3. Attached the error screenshot.
